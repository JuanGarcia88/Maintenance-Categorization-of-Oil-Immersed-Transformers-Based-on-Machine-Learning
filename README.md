# Maintenance-Categorization-of-Oil-Immersed-Transformers-Based-on-Machine-Learning
This article proposes a methodology that applies unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques to support maintenance decision-making for oil-immersed power transformers. The proposed approach enables the categorization of transformer maintenance needs by integrating real test data with clustering and classification models. The methodology consists of three main stages: database construction from dissolved gas analysis and oil quality tests, unsupervised learning for transformer condition grouping using clustering algorithms, and supervised learning for maintenance classification using the XGBoost algorithm. Each stage is described in detail to ensure transparency and reproducibility, addressing the lack of standardized data-driven approaches for transformer maintenance in power systems. Additionally, a practical case study is presented using historical test records, where the methodology is validated by accurately identifying maintenance categories and supporting proactive decision-making. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach can improve maintenance planning, reduce the risk of unexpected failures, and optimize asset management in electrical networks.
